# Task 24: Version Control (Deployment)

## Description
In this repository, you will find the link of a CV as well as all the files that were responsible for making the CV look the way that it does when you load the link.

## How to access the project
To view the final version of the cv, click on the settings button. On the lefthand side of the settings menu, you will find the pages section, select that. After you have selected the "pages" option, the link to the website will be underneath the GitHub section's heading.

## How to use this website
Once the site has loaded, there will only be one page displaying all the contents within the cv. There are different sections within the cv, which are:

1. Image (on the left)
2. Name as well as profession and a short bio (next to the image)
3. Contact information (below the image and bio)
4. Skills and competencies (below the contact information)
5. Personal achievements (next to the skills and competencies)
6. Education History (below the skills and competencies section)
7. Work Experience (below the education history section)
